# cat_fact
cat fact cli

## Installation Instructions

Create and activate virtual environment.

```bash
  $ virtualenvironment venv
  $ source ./venv/bin/activate
```
Now run `python setup.py install`, this will install `catFact` command into the virtual environment

If running `catFact` says command not found, deactivate and activate the virtual environment. That should fix it.
